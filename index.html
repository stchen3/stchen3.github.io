			I am a third year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Department of Statistics</font></a> at North Carolina State University.
			My research focuses on testing variance components for application to functional data analysis. I also work with my advisor, <a href="http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~xiao/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Dr. Luo Xiao</font></a>, on projects relating to child growth 
			as part of the Healthy Birth, Growth and Development Knowlege Integration (HBGDki) group at the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundataion</font></a>.
			My research interests are in functional and longitudinal data, with applications to health and environmental issues.

			I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in 2013 with a dual B.S. in Environmental Science and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.
			I was part of the <a href="http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/~nsheldon/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Continential Environments Research Group (CERG)</font></a>
			and worked on projects surveying modern and ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolith" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>phytoliths</font></a>, and soil isotopes for reconstructing ancient environments.
			My honors thesis was on the nutritional ecology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_snub-nosed_monkey" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys</font></a>, and
			I spent a year in China on a Fulbright Scholarship continuing that research before starting my PhD in Statistics in 2014.

			In my (limited) free time, I am a volunteer dog walker at the <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/pets/adoptions/Pages/default.aspx" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Wake County Animal Center</font></a>, where I adopted my rescue dog, Furby.
			We love to roadtrip and are fond of battlefields and other historical sites.
			At UM, I was part of the <a href="http://umich.edu/~mict/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Michigan Ice Carving Team</font></a>.
