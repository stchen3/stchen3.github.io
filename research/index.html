	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<h3> Academic Statistics </h3>
	<p>I am currently working on two thesis projects on model testing in functional data methods. 
	In the first project, we propose a Bootstrap-based procedure for testing covariance in longitudinal data, with specific application to testing Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models.
	I presented preliminary results at the 2017 Joint Statistical Meetings in Balitmore, MD.
	In the second project, we develop a model testing procedure for binary scalar-on-function data.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Applied Statistics </h3>
	I am currently a Graduate Industrial Trainee with the <a href="http://ipacrs.org/strategic-initiatives/ba-be-ivic-clinical/pbe-working-group/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Population Bioequivalence (PBE) </font></a> of IPAC-RS.
	We are studying the performance characteristics of the PBE criterion for evaluating in-vitro data for inhaled products.
	A paper covering application to delivered dose measurement from metered dose inhalers has just been submitted, and a technical report is available online for IPAC-RS members.
