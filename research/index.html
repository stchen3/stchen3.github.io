	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<p> My research interests are in the application and testing of functional data methods, particularly functional principal
	components analysis and functional linear models. 
	My applied research with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Healthy Birth and Growth Knowledge Initiative (HBGDki)
	focuses on the use of nonparametric methods for modeling and prediction of fetal and child growth.
	My applied work with the IPAC-RS Population Bioequivalence (PBE) working group explores the performance of
	the PBE and other equivalence criteria for evaluating bioequivalence in aerosol medications.
	In a previous academic life, I was involved in geology and paleobotany research on the use of phytoliths and isotopes
	for past environment reconstruction. My honors thesis was on the nutritional ecology of golden snub-nosed monkeys.
