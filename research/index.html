	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<p> I'm interested in the development and application of functional data methods, particularly functional principal
	components analysis and functional linear models. My PhD thesis is on model testing for functional data, including goodness-of-fit tests for covariance models and binary data.
	My applied research with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Healthy Birth and Growth Knowledge Initiative (HBGDki)
	focuses on the use of nonparametric methods for modeling and prediction of fetal and child growth.
	My applied work with the IPAC-RS Population Bioequivalence (PBE) working group explores the performance of
	the PBE and other equivalence criteria for evaluating <i> in vitro </i> bioequivalence in aerosol medications. </p>
	<p> In a previous academic life, I was part of the <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/nsheldon/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Continential Environments Research Group</font></a>
	and <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sysmith-lab/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Smith Lab</font></a> conducting geology and paleobotany research on the use of phytoliths and isotopes
	for environmental reconstruction. My honors thesis was on the nutritional ecology of golden snub-nosed monkeys in China.
