	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<p> Research plays a small, but key part in my current role at Eli Lilly. Our research is primarily in educating and communicating
		statistical results to non-technical audiences. We are developing methods and metrics that are interpretable and drive
		critical business decisions, while also representing statistical variability and uncertainty. In my free time,
		I lend out my statistical expertise for a range of applications.
	
	<p> My Ph.D. thesis was on the development and application of 
	<a href="https://functionaldata.wordpress.ncsu.edu/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>functional data</font></a> methods, 
		including goodness-of-fit tests for covariance models and non-Gaussian data.
		I was also part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Healthy Birth and Growth Knowledge Initiative (HBGDki),
		developing nonparametric methods for modeling and prediction of fetal and child growth.
	My applied work with the IPAC-RS Population Bioequivalence (PBE) working group explored the performance of
	the PBE and other equivalence criteria for evaluating <i> in vitro </i> bioequivalence in aerosol medications.
	</p>

	<p> In a previous academic life, I was part of the <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/nsheldon/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Continential Environments Research Group</font></a>
	and <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/sysmith-lab/" target="blank"><font color=#FF3636>Smith Lab</font></a> conducting geology and paleobotany research on the use of phytoliths and isotopes
	for environmental reconstruction. My undergraduate honors thesis and Fulbright scholarship work was on the nutritional 
	ecology of golden snub-nosed monkeys in China. I still collaborate in the ecological space on statistical modeling.
